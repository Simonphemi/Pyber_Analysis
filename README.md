# Pyber_Analysis_Overview
create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Analysis
By City type, we can notice the more urban cities have the most traffic for the use of pyber to be implemented. However in the rural and suburban areas there is a spike in the average fare per ride and also the average fare by driver, this could have been caused by scarcity of drivers willing to operate within these citys as opposed to the urban cities.

## Summary
I would recomend the CEO should, increase the number of drivers within the suburban and rural areas, in order to lower the current price and give an increase to demand in service within these cities .Also the CEO should monitor the seasons and dates which services are most used within each city type, using the multiple line graph as a yard stick.
